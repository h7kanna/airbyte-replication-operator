# Why implement Airbyte Protocol

## Context and Problem Statement

How to make [Official Airbyte Platform](https://github.com/airbytehq/airbyte-platform) implementation more modular and
efficient?
<br/>
For example, Official Airbyte implementation has some complicated micro-orchestration of socat forwarding and TCP port
management from workers. Is a simpler implementation possible with same stability guarantee? <br/>
More importantly, How to make it standalone for simple use-cases?
<br/>
[Temporal](https://temporal.io/) is
the [coolest](https://h7kanna.medium.com/what-happens-when-you-ask-a-product-person-and-a-software-engineer-to-build-a-data-pipeline-cbbfd2173ff6)
of the application development technologies? But can we make it optional for replications?

## Considered Options

- Option A, Some
  previous [attempts](https://h7kanna.medium.com/why-and-how-i-integrated-airbyte-and-apache-hudi-c18aff3af21a)
- Option B, Implement core data-plane components of
  the [Official Airbyte](https://docs.airbyte.com/understanding-airbyte/high-level-view) in a modular and pluggable way.

## Decision Outcome

Chosen option: Option B, Independent and the Path of least resistance. :smiley:
